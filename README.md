# Augmented Reality Experiments

This is a project I created in my second year of Media Design. It is an
Home Automation appliction with Tuya Smart Devices and Sequematic Webhook service..

For this project I created a React Application. This allows me to use the UseState for the buttons and components. But before I start programming, I need to create all of the Webhooks for every sequence. SEQUEmatic needs to be linked with your Tuya account in order to create these sequences. 
 
## What is a webhook?

A webhook is a lightweight API that powers one-way data sharing triggered by events. Together, they enable applications to share data and functionality, and turn the web into something greater than the sum of its parts. APIs and webhooks both allow different software systems to sync up and share information.





## Installation

Install react

```bash
  npm install react
  cd my-project
```

## Creating a sequence in SEQUEmatic

```bash
  Step 1: Generate a custom Webhook Call trigger that will run this sequence as soon as the webhook is called.
```

```bash
  Step 2: Select the desired Smart Device  (Kitchen Light in this example)
```

## Deployment
